## Project purpose
This project identifies Montréal economic-activity areas near mapped greenspaces to highlight likely locations for possible green rehabilitation and other urban greening initiatives.

## Core action
A city or environmental planner can explore which economic areas are closest to mapped greenspace and use that proximity as a screening step for prioritizing future green rehabilitation opportunities.

## How to run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Start Live Server from `site/index.html` (do not open the HTML file directly).
3. Use the layer selector to compare economic areas within 100 m, 100–500 m, and over 500 m of mapped greenspace, alongside local green spaces and broad economic planning zones for context.
4. Click a mapped feature to see its greenspace distance and overlap with an economic planning zone.

Run `python3 -m pip install pyshp shapely` if these Python packages are not installed. Run `python3 Notebooks/process_building_footprints.py` to download Montréal's source data, classify roof outlines, and regenerate `Data/buildings/building_footprints_in_economic_zones.geojson`. Then start Live Server from `site/index.html` (do not open the HTML file directly). The existing analysis notebook is in `Notebooks/project.ipynb`.

The processing keeps a roof outline when at least 50% of its area overlaps the union of the economic-activity zones. Its greenspace distance is measured edge-to-edge from that roof outline to the nearest mapped greenspace. The website separates these distances into within 100 m, over 100 m through 500 m, and over 500 m. The source may group adjacent roof surfaces, so its features are not guaranteed to correspond one-to-one with buildings. Planning zones remain available as an optional context layer.

## Layer B check
- **Value and legend:** Roof outlines are coloured by distance to mapped greenspace, in metres. The legend uses the same classes as the map: 0–100 m, over 100 through 500 m, and over 500 m. All three classes contain roof outlines in the current data.
- **Layer switcher:** The roof-distance layers can be toggled alongside the local greenspace dataset and the economic planning zones.
- **Second-layer receipt:** The local greenspace layer uses the supplied `Data/affect_espacevertlocal/affect_espacevertlocal.json` dataset (1,232 features in EPSG:32188). `site/app.js` converts its coordinates to WGS 84 for Leaflet and exposes it as “Local green spaces” in the layer switcher.

## Not in this iteration
- Identifying individual businesses inside a building.
- Determining whether an economic area is vacant, abandoned, underused, publicly accessible, or suitable for green-space rehabilitation.
- Assessing green-space quality, access, ownership, or the practical feasibility of rehabilitation.
- A public website or a full site suitability score.

## AI disclosure
I used ChatGPT (GPT-6) and the integrated VS Copilot to help me develop my project. I asked it to help me troubleshoot my Python code, filter Montréal's land-use GeoJSON to identify economic-activity areas, and connect the processed data to my Leaflet webpage. I also asked for help incorporating green spaces and a 500-metre proximity analysis, improving the website layout and making the map layers easier to distinguish. 

I reviewed the suggestions and tested the map in my browser. I noticed that some economic-activity polygons covered large areas that appeared to include streets, so I added Montréal's 2016 building roof outlines as a more specific mapping layer. The outlines make mapped roof shapes easier to inspect, but they do not represent property parcels or identify businesses, and the older source data needs verification against current conditions.

I made the project decisions, including the intended audience, the purpose of the map, and the features I wanted to include. I used AI-generated explanations and code suggestions as assistance, rather than assuming they were automatically correct. The project still requires verification of the distance calculations, the green-space data source and licence, and the final output before submission.

## After the demo
The map shows economic areas located near mapped greenspaces.
The different colours represent different distance bands from greenspace for screening likely rehabilitation opportunities.

# Layer B 

Orange mapped features are within 100 m of greenspace, yellow features are over 100 m through 500 m away, and gray features are over 500 m away.

The second, computed roof-distance layer is created by `Notebooks/process_building_footprints.py`: it keeps 2016 roof outlines with at least 50% overlap with economic-activity zones and calculates each outline's edge-to-edge distance to the nearest mapped greenspace in metres. The total check is 4,780 outlines: 278 within 100 m + 1,778 over 100 through 500 m + 2,724 over 500 m = 4,780.
